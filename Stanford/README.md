#CS106A: Programming Methodology with Professor Mehran Sahami (playlist)

This was completed whilst watching [Stanford's *Programming Methodology* playlist on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMDCCdjyW8&list=PL84A56BC7F4A1F852) back in December 2015. I still haven't gotten round to finishing the playlist but hopefully will return to it when I have time.
